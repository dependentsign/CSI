In a moment of desperation, she made a choice that would forever alter the course of her life.

The tranquility of the night was shattered by the sound of an ambulance tearing through the streets of Maplewood, its sirens cutting through the silence like a knife. The vehicle rushed towards the lakeside cabin, where Sarah had been found in a state of distress.
