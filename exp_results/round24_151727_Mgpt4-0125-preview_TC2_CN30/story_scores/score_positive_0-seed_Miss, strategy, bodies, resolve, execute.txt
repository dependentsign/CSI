The story provided is incomplete, but based on the content given, it seems to be setting up a scenario that could potentially have both tragic and comedic elements, depending on how the story unfolds. However, given the information so far, the story leans more towards a dramatic or tragic tone with a hint of potential for a clever resolution that could be seen as comedic.

The story describes a serious situation with a city under siege, which is inherently tragic. However, the introduction of Miss Elara and her strategic mind suggests a potential for a clever resolution that could be seen as a form of comedy, especially if her plan involves unexpected twists or outwits the enemy in a humorous way.

Since the story is incomplete, I will base the scoring on the information provided:

{
  "TragedyDegree": 7,
  "ComedyDegree": 3
}

The Tragedy Degree is rated at 7 because the story sets up a scenario with a significant threat and a sense of desperation, which are strong tragic elements. The Comedy Degree is rated at 3 because there is a hint of potential for a clever and possibly humorous resolution, but this is not yet fully developed in the story.
