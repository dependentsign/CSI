Always was a peculiar little town nestled in the crook of a verdant valley, where the sun seemed to linger a bit longer in the sky and the stars twinkled with a knowing wink. It was a place where conversations flowed as easily as the gentle river that meandered through the heart of the community, and where every soul seemed to carry a story worth telling.

In Always, there lived a man named Thomas. Thomas was a solitary figure, often found in the quiet corners of the town's only library, his nose buried deep in books about far-off lands and ancient myths. He had a habit of talking to himself, which, in any other place, might have earned him a stigma, but in Always, it was simply part of his charm.

Despite his reclusive nature, Thomas had a passion for the stars. Every evening, without fail, he would set up his old brass telescope in the meadow on the outskirts of town, viewing the celestial dance with a reverence that bordered on the religious. The townsfolk would sometimes join him, lying on the soft grass, gazing up at the heavens, and sharing whispered dreams and silent wishes.

One night, as the town of Always slumbered, Thomas made a discovery that would change everything. Through his telescope, he spotted a new star, one that shone with an unusual hue, flickering like a cosmic flame in the inky blackness. Excited, he shared his finding with the town's people the next day. The news sparked a flurry of conversations, and for the first time in a long while, Thomas found himself at the center of attention.

The people of Always, who had always respected Thomas's distance, now sought his insight. They asked him questions about the stars, about the universe, and about the new celestial body he had found. Thomas, who had always felt the stigma of being different, suddenly felt a sense of belonging he had never known before. The townsfolk's genuine interest and lack of judgment allowed him to open up, sharing not only his knowledge but also parts of himself he had long kept hidden.

As the days passed, the new star became a symbol of unity for Always. It was a reminder that sometimes, the things that make us different are the very things that can bring us together. Thomas continued his nightly viewings, but now he was never alone. There was always someone eager to learn, to listen, or simply to share in the silent wonder of the cosmos.

And so, the little town of Always thrived, its conversations richer, its nights brighter, and its people closer than ever before. Thomas, once an outsider, had become the heart of the community, a living testament to the power of acceptance and the beauty of the stars that watch over us all.
