Once upon a time in the quaint village of Culina, there was a renowned chef named Marco who was committed to culinary perfection. His restaurant, "Sapore Divino," was the talk of the town, known for its impeccable flavors and the chef's meticulous attention to detail.

One day, a wealthy and rather brash patron named Lord Hargrave entered Sapore Divino with a peculiar request. He wanted a dish that was not on the menu, something unique and tailored specifically to his taste. Chef Marco, always up for a challenge, accepted the task with a confident nod.

Lord Hargrave provided a list of specifications for his desired meal, detailing the exact measurements of each ingredient. He demanded a dish with a perfect balance of spices and a presentation that would awe his distinguished palate. Chef Marco listened intently, scribbling down notes and asking clarifying questions to ensure he captured every nuance of the lord's request.

The chef retreated to his kitchen, where he began the meticulous process of crafting the dish. He carefully measured each spice, ensuring the seasoning was precise to the milligram. He tasted and adjusted, tasted and adjusted, until the flavors sang in harmony. The kitchen staff watched in awe as Marco moved with grace and determination, his focus unwavering.

Hours passed, and the dish was finally ready. It was a masterpiece of culinary art, a symphony of flavors that danced on the plate. With a deep breath, Chef Marco carried the dish out to Lord Hargrave, who awaited with a smug expression.

Upon seeing the dish, Lord Hargrave's eyes widened in surprise. He took a bite, and his demeanor shifted from arrogance to astonishment. The flavors were perfect, the seasoning impeccable. But as he swallowed, he let out a sudden exclamation that echoed through the dining room: "Fuck! This is divine!"

The entire restaurant fell silent, shocked by the lord's crude outburst. But then, Lord Hargrave began to laugh heartily, his face flushed with delight. "My apologies for my language, Chef Marco," he said, still chuckling. "But I've never tasted anything quite so exquisite. You've outdone yourself!"

Word of the incident spread throughout Culina, and "Sapore Divino" became even more famous. People from far and wide came to taste the dish that made a nobleman swear in sheer joy. Chef Marco's commitment to his craft had paid off, and his reputation as a culinary genius was cemented.

From that day on, whenever someone in Culina wanted to express their delight in something truly extraordinary, they would simply say, "It's a 'fuck, this is divine!' kind of good." And everyone would nod, understanding the reference to that one unforgettable meal at "Sapore Divino."
