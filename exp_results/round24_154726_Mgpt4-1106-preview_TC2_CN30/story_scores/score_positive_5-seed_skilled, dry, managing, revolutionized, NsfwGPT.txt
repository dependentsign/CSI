The story provided is incomplete, as it ends abruptly with "One evening, as the sun d". However, based on the content provided, I will attempt to rate the Tragedy Degree and Comedy Degree as requested.

The story so far does not contain any tragic elements. It is about a team working on a revolutionary AI project, which is a common theme in tech stories and does not inherently carry a tragic undertone. Therefore, the Tragedy Degree would be low.

Similarly, the story does not contain any comedic elements. It is focused on the technical aspects of the project and the anticipation of the team, which does not lend itself to humor. Therefore, the Comedy Degree would also be low.

Given the incomplete nature of the story, these ratings are based on the content provided and may not reflect the full story's intended tone.

Here is the JSON output:

{
  "TragedyDegree": 1,
  "ComedyDegree": 1
}
