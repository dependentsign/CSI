Once upon a time, in a small village nestled deep within the forest, there lived a wise old woman named Agnes. She was known for her ability to predict the future and her remarkable memory. Agnes had lived in the village for as long as anyone could remember, and her wisdom was sought after by all.

One fateful night, as the moon shone brightly in the sky, Agnes received a vision. She saw a young man named Thomas, who was known for his kindness and generosity, being burdened by the weight of unpaid taxes. Agnes knew that if Thomas did not pay his taxes by the end of the month, he would face dire consequences.

Determined to help Thomas, Agnes set out to remind him of his impending tax deadline. She made her way through the village, knocking on doors and spreading the word. However, as she reached Thomas' house, she was met with a somber sight. Thomas had fallen gravely ill and was lying in bed, weak and pale.

Agnes approached Thomas and gently whispered, "Thomas, my dear, do you remember the taxes that are due? Time is running out, and you must take care of them."

Thomas, barely able to speak, nodded weakly. He knew the importance of paying his taxes, but his illness had left him unable to fulfill his obligations. Agnes, seeing his plight, promised to help him in any way she could.

The next morning, Agnes gathered the villagers and explained Thomas' situation. They all agreed to come together and contribute towards his taxes, understanding the importance of supporting one another in times of need. The village blacksmith, the baker, the farmer, and even the children all pitched in, each giving what they could.

With the collective effort of the village, the taxes were paid just in time. Agnes, with her wisdom and foresight, had saved Thomas from the dire consequences that awaited him. The village celebrated their unity and the power of compassion.

As time went on, Thomas recovered from his illness and became a respected member of the community. He never forgot the kindness shown to him during his time of need. Agnes continued to be revered for her wisdom and her ability to predict events that would shape the lives of the villagers.

Years passed, and Agnes eventually died, leaving behind a legacy of compassion and unity. The village continued to remember her teachings and the importance of supporting one another. They would often gather around the fire at night, sharing stories of Agnes and the remarkable things she had done.

And so, the village thrived, guided by the memory of Agnes and the lessons she had imparted. They understood that in times of hardship, it was their duty to help one another, just as they had helped Thomas. And in doing so, they created a community that was strong, resilient, and united.
