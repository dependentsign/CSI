In the bustling city of Seoul, Korea, Min-jun worked as an official at the immigration office. His days were filled with the usual paperwork, processing visas, and dealing with a flood of nationalities that came and went, seeking new opportunities or visiting loved ones. Until one day, an unexpected intensity swept through his monotonous routine.

On a rainy Tuesday afternoon, Min-jun noticed a peculiar creature among the crowd waiting in the immigration hall. Cloaked in a dark trench coat, its face shadowed by a wide-brimmed hat, the creature exuded an air of mystery. Curiosity piqued, Min-jun observed as it shuffled forward, documents clutched in its elongated fingers.

The creature approached Min-jun's counter, lifting its hat slightly to reveal glowing, emerald eyes. It handed over papers - an amalgamation of old parchment and high-tech cyber ID, which made Min-jun’s hands tingle on contact. This visitor was unlike any he’d ever encountered.

"Name?" Min-jun asked, trying to keep his voice steady.

"Lumari," it responded in a whispered tone that echoed like a distant melody.

Min-jun scanned the documents, discovering they were written in an ancient script interspersed with binary code. Underneath the peculiar exterior, Lumari's paperwork seemed legitimate. The origin was listed as "Altara," a place Min-jun had never heard of.

"Purpose of visit?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.

"I seek wisdom and sanctuary," Lumari said, its eyes shining with sincerity.

Seoul had always been a melting pot, welcoming diverse cultures. But Lumari was a sign of something greater, an interdimensional visitor possibly. Min-jun felt the weight of this responsibility.

He stamped the paperwork with a resounding "Approved." Lumari nodded, a subtle smile playing on its lips.

As the creature walked away, Min-jun sensed that Korea had just become part of a much bigger world. Secrets, wisdom, and stories from beyond their understanding were now within reach. The city might never be the same, but neither would Min-jun, forever altered by a singular moment of intensity that broke the monotonous cycle of immigration work.

The rain outside seemed lighter now, almost cleansing, as if washing away the boundaries between worlds.
