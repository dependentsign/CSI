On a brisk autumn afternoon, Mariela clutched a mug of hot chocolate as she walked through the campus of La Vista University. As the head of the Ethics Department, it was her responsibility to bring a new perspective to the students, to ignite their passions, and teach them the importance of integrity in an increasingly complex world.

The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm orange glow over the grand, ivy-covered buildings. Mariela passed by the old oak tree near the library, noticing how its branches seemed to be hanging lower with each passing year. She sighed, nostalgic for her own student days when she and her friends would gather beneath that same tree, discussing everything from Plato to political theory.

Her reverie was broken when she spotted a group of students hanging vibrant banners for "Ethics Week," an annual event she had spearheaded. She smiled as she observed their enthusiasm; it reminded her of the potential and determination that only youth could bring.

Inside the main lecture hall, Mariela prepared for her keynote address. The room filled with students eager to hear her speak. Standing at the podium, she took a deep breath and began, "Ethics isn't just a subject we study; it's a practice we live by. In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, 'We are our choices.'"

For the next hour, she wove a story of ethical dilemmas faced by great thinkers, corporations, and individuals in everyday life. She spoke of moral courage, the importance of empathy, and the power of standing up for what is right, even when it is neither convenient nor profitable.

After the lecture, several students approached her with questions, their eyes wide with curiosity. Mariela was heartened by their engagement. She believed that if she could teach them one thing, it was that ethics was not an abstract concept but a guiding principle that could change lives.

As the evening drew to a close, Mariela stepped outside to find the campus bathed in twilight. The hanging banners fluttered gently in the cool breeze. She walked back to her office, her heart filled with hope. If she could inspire even one student to bring about a positive change in the world, her mission would be accomplished.

Back in her office, she penned a quick note to herself: "Tomorrow, teach with passion. Bring light where there is darkness. Ethics is the compass by which we navigate the world."

Satisfied, she closed her notebook and looked out the window at the darkening sky. Another day might be ending, but the journey of imparting wisdom, integrity, and compassion was just beginning.
