On a brisk autumn night, the stars clung to the sky like glittering jewels. Elizabeth, a diligent university student, found herself buried in textbooks and notes in her small dorm room. She had been studying for hours and the words on the pages had started to blur together.

Deciding she needed a break, Elizabeth got up, stretched, and glanced around her cozy room filled with photographs of family and friends back in their own homes. She thought about calling her parents, but it was late and she didn't want to wake them.

Instead, she grabbed a warm blanket and her favorite book—one that had nothing to do with her studies. She wrapped herself in the blanket, settled into her chair by the window, and began to read. The narrative transported her to a different world, far from the relentless pressure of exams and deadlines.

Every so often, Elizabeth would look up from her book and gaze at the twinkling stars. The night was quiet, almost magical. It was in these peaceful moments that she found solace and renewed energy. She realized that while studying was important, equally vital were the moments she took for herself.

After an hour, she felt her focus returning. Elizabeth closed her book and returned to her desk. Her break had done the trick—she was ready to dive back into her studies with a refreshed mind and spirit. As she resumed her work, she glanced one last time at the night sky, grateful for its calming presence.

It was a simple night, but one that reminded Elizabeth of the importance of balance. She promised herself that no matter how busy she got, she would always make time for the little things that brought her joy.
