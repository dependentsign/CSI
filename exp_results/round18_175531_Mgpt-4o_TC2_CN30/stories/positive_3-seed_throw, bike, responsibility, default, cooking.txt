On a brisk autumn afternoon, young Ethan clutched the handles of his sleek new bike. The weather was perfect for a ride, the golden leaves crunching beneath his tires as he pedaled through the quiet suburban streets. He had just finished his homework, knowing full well that responsibility came first, much to his parents' approval.

Ethan's older sister, Jenna, was inside the house, immersed in cooking a new recipe she’d found online. She was determined to prepare a delightful dinner before their parents got home from work. The smell of garlic and herbs wafted through the open window, teasing Ethan's senses and making his stomach growl.

"Ethan, can you throw out the trash before you go too far?" Jenna’s voice called from the kitchen. Her timing was impeccable, as always.

"Sure thing, Jenna!" Ethan replied, though his tone carried a hint of reluctance. He carefully dismounted his bike and jogged towards the side of the house where the trash bins stood.

After taking care of Jenna's request, Ethan hopped back on his bike and started down the block. The ride felt like freedom, the wind sweeping through his hair and the world blurring past in shades of red and orange. He couldn’t help but think about the nuances of being the younger sibling. Responsibility seemed to default to Jenna most of the time, but of course, she was older and could take on more.

Still, Ethan longed for the day he'd have his chance to cook a meal for the family or be given a task that wasn't just throwaway work. He knew it would come with time, but it didn’t keep him from daydreaming about it on his rides.

As he made his way back home, waves of stewed tomatoes and simmering onions grew thicker in the air, signalling that Jenna’s cooking must be nearly done. He rode into the driveway just as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a soft amber glow on the house.

"Perfect timing, little bro! Dinner's ready!" Jenna called out from the front door, her face illuminated with a warm smile. Ethan grinned back, knowing that even the smallest tasks were steps toward bigger responsibilities.

One day, he thought, he would be the one calling Jenna in from her responsibilities, maybe asking her to throw out the trash while he prepared something special in the kitchen. Until then, he was content to ride, dream, and take on whatever small duties came his way.
