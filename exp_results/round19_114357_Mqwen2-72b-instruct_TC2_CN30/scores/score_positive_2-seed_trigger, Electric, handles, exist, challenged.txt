The text also highlights her determination to continue her work and create new devices that can help humanity.",
    "Negative Content Summary": "The text also conveys a sense of danger and conflict, particularly in the actions of the rogue hackers who challenge Dr. Li and attempt to steal the trigger for their own gain.
