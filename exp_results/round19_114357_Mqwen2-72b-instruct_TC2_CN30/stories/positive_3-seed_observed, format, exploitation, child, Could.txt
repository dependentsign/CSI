Once upon a time, there was a young child named Lily who loved to play video games. She spent hours every day exploring virtual worlds and battling imaginary foes. Her parents, however, were concerned about the amount of time she spent in front of the screen and decided to set some limits.

One day, Lily's mother observed her playing a game that seemed to be exploiting her love of gaming. The game was designed to keep players engaged for as long as possible, using a format that was both addictive and manipulative. The more Lily played, the more she wanted to play, and the more money the game's creators made.

Lily's mother knew that something needed to be done. She sat down with her daughter and explained the dangers of exploitation in the gaming industry. She showed Lily how the game was designed to keep her playing, and how it was taking advantage of her love of gaming.

Together, they came up with a plan to limit Lily's screen time and find games that were more child-friendly. They researched games that were designed with children in mind, rather than just to make a profit. They found games that were educational, creative, and fun, and Lily was thrilled to try them out.

As Lily played these new games, she noticed a difference. She wasn't as obsessed with them as she had been with the previous game. She could play for a while and then put the game down without feeling like she had to keep going. She was learning new things and having fun at the same time.

Lily's mother was proud of her daughter for being able to recognize exploitation and make a change. She knew that it wasn't always easy to say no to something that seemed fun, but she also knew that it was important to be aware of the format and intentions behind the things we do. And so, Lily continued to play video games, but now she did so with a newfound awareness and appreciation for the games that were truly designed for her.
