Karen had always been a stickler for establishing clear boundaries in her relationships. She believed that without them, misunderstandings and issues were bound to arise. So when she invited her friend, Sarah, over for dinner, she made sure to set some ground rules.

As Karen placed a plate of food in front of Sarah, she explained that she was trying to divide her time more evenly between work and her personal life. She didn't want her job to consume all of her energy and leave her with nothing left to give to her loved ones.

Sarah nodded in understanding, but Karen could sense that there was an issue brewing beneath the surface. She knew that Sarah had always been a workaholic, and the idea of setting limits on her own time was foreign to her.

As they ate, Karen could feel the tension building between them. She knew that she needed to address the issue head-on if they were going to maintain their friendship.

"Sarah, I want you to know that I value our time together," Karen said, putting down her fork. "But I also need to prioritize my own well-being. I hope you can understand that."

Sarah looked taken aback for a moment, but then she nodded slowly. "I get it," she said. "I've been so focused on my career that I've neglected my personal life. Maybe I need to start establishing some boundaries of my own."

Karen smiled, relieved that her friend was willing to listen. As they finished their meal, she felt a sense of peace knowing that they had addressed the issue and could move forward with a stronger, more balanced relationship.
