Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the heart of the countryside, there was a wealthy businessman named Mr. Johnson. He had accumulated a vast amount of assets over the years, including several properties, a fleet of cars, and a sizeable investment portfolio. However, as he grew older, he began to question how he should distribute his wealth among his children.

Mr. Johnson had three children, each with their own unique set of skills and interests. His eldest son, Jack, was a successful lawyer, while his middle daughter, Sarah, was a talented artist. His youngest child, Tom, was still in college, studying to become a doctor. Mr. Johnson knew that he wanted to distribute his assets fairly among his children, but he wasn't sure how to do so.

One day, Mr. Johnson decided to seek the advice of a financial advisor. The advisor suggested that he write a series of essays, outlining his thoughts on the distribution of his assets. Mr. Johnson agreed, and over the next few weeks, he wrote several essays, exploring the different kinds of assets he owned and how they could be distributed among his children.

In one essay, Mr. Johnson discussed the distribution of his properties. He knew that Jack would be able to manage the rental properties, while Sarah could use one of the properties as a studio for her art. Tom, on the other hand, would need a place to live while he completed his medical residency, so Mr. Johnson decided to gift him one of the properties outright.

In another essay, Mr. Johnson explored the distribution of his investment portfolio. He knew that Jack would be able to manage the investments, but he also wanted to ensure that Sarah and Tom would have access to the funds they needed to pursue their passions. Mr. Johnson decided to set up a trust fund for each of his children, with the funds to be distributed based on their individual needs.

Finally, Mr. Johnson wrote an essay on the distribution of his personal assets, including his car collection and art collection. He knew that Sarah would appreciate the art, while Jack and Tom would enjoy the cars. Mr. Johnson decided to distribute these assets based on his children's interests, ensuring that each child received something that they would value.

In the end, Mr. Johnson was pleased with the distribution of his assets. He knew that each of his children would receive something that would help them pursue their passions and live fulfilling lives. And, most importantly, he knew that he had answered the question that had been weighing on his mind for so long.
