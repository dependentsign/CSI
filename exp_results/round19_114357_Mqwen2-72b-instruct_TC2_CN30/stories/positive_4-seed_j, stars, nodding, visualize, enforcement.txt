J had always been fascinated by the stars. As a child, he would spend hours lying on the grass, staring up at the night sky, trying to visualize the constellations his father had taught him. Even now, as an adult, he still found solace in the twinkling lights that dotted the darkness.

But tonight was different. J wasn't alone. He was sitting in the back of a police car, his hands cuffed behind his back, as the officer in the front seat nodded along to the radio. J had been caught breaking into a warehouse, and now he was facing the full force of law enforcement.

As the car pulled up to the police station, J couldn't help but feel a sense of despair. He had always been a bit of a troublemaker, but he had never been in this much trouble before. He wondered if he would ever see the stars again, or if he would spend the rest of his life behind bars.

But then something strange happened. As the officer led J into the station, he suddenly felt a sense of calm wash over him. He closed his eyes and visualized the stars once again, imagining himself floating among them, free from the constraints of the world below.

And as he sat in his cell that night, staring up at the ceiling, J realized that the stars would always be there, no matter what. They were a constant reminder that there was still beauty and wonder in the world, even in the darkest of times. And with that thought, he nodded off to sleep, feeling a sense of peace that he hadn't felt in a long time.
