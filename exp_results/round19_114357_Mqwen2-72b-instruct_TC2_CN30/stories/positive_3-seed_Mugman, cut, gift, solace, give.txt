Mugman had always been a collector of oddities. His small, cluttered apartment was filled with strange trinkets and curiosities that he had picked up over the years. But there was one item in his collection that held a special place in his heart: a small, intricately carved wooden mug.

The mug had been a gift from his late grandmother, who had passed away when he was just a child. She had given it to him on his tenth birthday, telling him that it was a family heirloom that had been passed down for generations. Mugman had treasured the gift ever since, and it had become a source of solace for him during the darkest moments of his life.

But one day, while cleaning his apartment, Mugman accidentally cut himself on a piece of broken glass. The cut was deep, and blood began to seep out of the wound. Panicked, Mugman reached for the nearest thing he could find to staunch the bleeding: his beloved wooden mug.

He pressed the mug against the cut, and to his surprise, the bleeding stopped almost immediately. Mugman was amazed. He had always known that the mug was special, but he had never imagined that it had healing properties.

From that day on, Mugman began to use the mug to help others. He would visit hospitals and nursing homes, offering the mug as a gift to those who were suffering. And each time, the mug would work its magic, bringing solace and relief to those in need.

Mugman became known as the "Mugman of Mercy," and people would come from all over to seek his help. And though he never asked for anything in return, he found that the act of giving brought him a joy and fulfillment that he had never known before.

In the end, Mugman realized that the true gift of the wooden mug was not its healing powers, but the opportunity it had given him to make a difference in the lives of others. And he knew that he would continue to give, for as long as he had breath in his body.
