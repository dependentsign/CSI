Once upon a time, there was a man named H who was known for his wisdom. He had spent his entire life learning and gathering knowledge, and he was always eager to share his insights with others. However, despite his wisdom, H had never taken out insurance for himself. He believed that he was invincible and that nothing bad would ever happen to him.

One day, while walking down the street, H was hit by a car. The accident left him with severe injuries, and he was rushed to the hospital. As he lay in his hospital bed, H realized the foolishness of his decision not to take out insurance. He had always been so focused on his wisdom that he had neglected to take care of his own well-being.

Fortunately, H's friends and family rallied around him and helped him through his recovery. They treated him with kindness and compassion, and they made sure that he had everything he needed to get back on his feet. H was grateful for their support, and he vowed to never take his health for granted again.

After he was discharged from the hospital, H took out a comprehensive insurance policy that covered all of his medical expenses. He also started to take better care of himself, eating healthier foods and exercising regularly. He realized that wisdom was not just about knowledge, but also about taking care of oneself and being prepared for the unexpected.

From that day on, H was known not only for his wisdom but also for his common sense. He had learned a valuable lesson from his accident, and he was determined to use his experience to help others. He started giving talks on the importance of taking out insurance and taking care of one's health, and he became a respected voice in his community. And so, H lived the rest of his life not only as a wise man but also as a wise and responsible one.
