Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a group of friends who loved to spend their weekends together. They had different preferences when it came to food, but they always managed to find a way to satisfy everyone's taste buds. One day, they decided to order a pizza for dinner, but they couldn't agree on the toppings.

Samantha, the leader of the group, suggested they divide the pizza into four equal parts, each with a different topping. This way, everyone could have their preference without any arguments. The group agreed, and they placed their order.

As they waited for the pizza to arrive, they played video games on the console. They were so engrossed in the game that they didn't hear the doorbell ring. It was only when the pizza delivery guy knocked on the door that they realized the pizza had arrived.

They quickly paused the game and gathered around the table to enjoy their meal. The pizza was delicious, and everyone was happy with their choice of toppings. They spent the rest of the evening chatting and laughing, enjoying each other's company.

As the night came to an end, they realized they had saved some money by ordering one large pizza instead of four small ones. They decided to put the money aside for their next outing, which they planned to spend on a fun activity that they could all enjoy together.

From that day on, they always made sure to divide their pizza into equal parts, so everyone could have their preference. They also made it a habit to save money for their future outings, knowing that they could always count on each other for a good time.
