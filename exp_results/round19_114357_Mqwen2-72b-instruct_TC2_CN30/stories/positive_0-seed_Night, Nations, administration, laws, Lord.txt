In the heart of the night, when the world was shrouded in darkness, the Nations of the world gathered in a grand hall. They had come to discuss the administration of their lands, the laws that governed their people, and the future of their nations.

As they sat around a large table, each leader spoke of their own concerns and desires. Some wanted more power, others wanted more wealth, and still, others wanted peace. But as they spoke, a figure appeared at the end of the table. It was the Lord, the one who had created the world and all that was in it.

The Nations fell silent as the Lord spoke. "You have come together to discuss the administration of your lands and the laws that govern your people. But have you considered the laws that govern the universe? The laws that I have set in place since the beginning of time?"

The Nations looked at each other, unsure of what to say. They had never considered the laws of the universe, only the laws of their own nations.

The Lord continued, "My laws are not written in stone, but they are written in the hearts of all people. They are the laws of love, compassion, and justice. These are the laws that should govern your nations, not the laws of power and greed."

The Nations listened intently, realizing the truth in the Lord's words. They knew that they had been focused on their own desires, rather than the needs of their people. They knew that they needed to change.

As the night wore on, the Nations discussed how they could implement the Lord's laws in their own nations. They talked of ways to promote love, compassion, and justice, and how they could work together to create a better world for all people.

And as the sun began to rise, the Nations left the hall, determined to make a difference. They knew that it would not be easy, but they also knew that it was the right thing to do. For they had learned that the laws of the universe were not just written in the hearts of all people, but also in the hearts of all nations.
