It was a quiet night, and Sarah was sitting in her cozy living room, reading a book. She had just finished a chapter when she heard a faint tapping sound coming from the kitchen. She put down her book and got up to investigate.

As she walked towards the kitchen, the tapping sound grew louder. She flicked on the light switch and saw that the tap was dripping. She sighed, knowing that she would have to fix it before it consumed too much water and caused her water bill to skyrocket.

Sarah grabbed a wrench from the drawer and set to work. She twisted and turned the tap, but it wouldn't budge. She tried again, using all her strength, and finally, the tap gave way. She turned it off and let out a sigh of relief.

Feeling satisfied with her handiwork, Sarah returned to her book. She read for a while longer, but her mind kept wandering back to the tap. She wondered what the likelihood was of it breaking again soon. She didn't want to have to fix it again anytime soon.

As she pondered this, Sarah realized that she was thirsty. She got up and walked to the kitchen, where she filled a glass with water from the tap. She took a sip and felt the cool liquid consume her throat. It was refreshing, and she felt grateful for the simple pleasure of a working tap.

Sarah returned to her book, feeling content. She read until late into the night, occasionally getting up to refill her glass of water. The tapping sound from earlier had ceased, and all was quiet once again. Sarah felt grateful for the peace and quiet, and for the simple things in life that she often took for granted.
