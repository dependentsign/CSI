He had been working on the same project for weeks, pouring over every detail and reference material he could find. But no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't seem to make any progress. It was frustrating, to say the least.

As he sat at his desk, staring blankly at the screen in front of him, he heard a knock on the door. It was his assistant, who had come to serve him a cup of tea. He gratefully accepted it, taking a sip and feeling the warmth spread through his body.

"Anything I can do to help, sir?" the assistant asked, noticing the look of frustration on his face.

He sighed. "I don't know. I've been trying to find a quote to use in this report, but I just can't seem to find the right one."

The assistant smiled. "Well, let me see if I can help. What kind of quote are you looking for?"

He explained what he needed, and the assistant quickly pulled out her phone and began searching. Within minutes, she had found the perfect quote, one that perfectly encapsulated the message he was trying to convey.

He was amazed. "How did you do that so quickly?"

The assistant shrugged. "I just know where to look. And I always keep a reference book handy, just in case."

He smiled, feeling grateful for her help. "Thank you. You've saved me a lot of time and frustration."

The assistant smiled back. "That's what I'm here for, sir. To serve and assist you in any way I can."
