In a world where the impact of a single touch could be deadly, the government had imposed strict restrictions on physical contact. The streets were empty, and the only sound that could be heard was the shattering of glass as people accidentally bumped into each other.

Amidst this chaos, there was a young girl named Lily who had a rare condition that made her immune to the deadly touch. She was the only one who could venture out into the world without fear of hurting others. Her parents, however, were overprotective and kept her locked up in their glass house, where she could only observe the world from behind the safety of the transparent walls.

Lily longed to explore the world and help others, but her parents' fear of losing her kept her confined. One day, she stumbled upon a group of people who were struggling to survive in the harsh world. They were in desperate need of food and medicine, but they couldn't risk going out to get it.

Lily knew she had to help them, but she also knew that her parents would never allow her to leave the safety of their glass house. She decided to take matters into her own hands and wrote a series of paragraphs explaining her condition and how she could help the group. She slipped the note under the door of her parents' bedroom and waited for their response.

To her surprise, her parents agreed to let her go, but only if she promised to be careful and protect herself. Lily was overjoyed and set out to help the group. She used her immunity to gather supplies and distribute them to those in need. Her impact was immediate, and soon, the group was thriving.

Lily's parents watched from the safety of their glass house, proud of their daughter's bravery and selflessness. They realized that sometimes, the best way to protect someone is to let them go and make a difference in the world. From that day on, they allowed Lily to venture out into the world, knowing that she would always come back to them, safe and sound.
