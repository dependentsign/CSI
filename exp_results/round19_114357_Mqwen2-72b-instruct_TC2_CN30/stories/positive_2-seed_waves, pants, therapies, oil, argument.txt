It was a beautiful day at the beach, the sun was shining and the waves were crashing against the shore. Sarah was enjoying the peacefulness of the ocean when she noticed a man sitting on a nearby rock, staring out at the water. She could see that he was wearing baggy pants and looked like he was lost in thought.

As she approached him, she noticed that he had a bottle of oil in his hand. She asked him if he was okay, and he replied that he was just trying to find some peace after an argument with his wife. Sarah listened intently as he explained that they had been going through a rough patch and that he had been trying different therapies to help them work through their issues.

Sarah, being a trained therapist herself, offered to listen and help him work through his feelings. They talked for hours, the sound of the waves providing a calming backdrop to their conversation. As they talked, the man began to relax and open up more, and Sarah could see that the oil he had been holding was actually a calming essential oil that he had been using to help him relax.

As the sun began to set, Sarah and the man said their goodbyes, both feeling a sense of peace and understanding. Sarah left the beach feeling grateful for the opportunity to help someone in need, and the man left feeling more hopeful about his future with his wife. The waves continued to crash against the shore, a reminder that even in the midst of turmoil, there is always a chance for peace and healing.
