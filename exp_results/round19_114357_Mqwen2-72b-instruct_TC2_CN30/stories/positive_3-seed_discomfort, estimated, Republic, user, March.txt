In the Republic of Zephyria, March was a month of discomfort for the citizens. The government had estimated that the annual spring festival would attract a large number of visitors, but they had failed to anticipate the sheer volume of people that would descend upon the city.

As a result, the streets were packed with tourists, and the locals found it difficult to navigate their way through the crowds. The user of the city's public transportation system was particularly affected, as the trains and buses were overcrowded and often delayed.

One resident, a young woman named Lila, had planned to attend the festival with her friends. However, the discomfort of the crowds and the estimated wait times for rides and attractions made her reconsider. She decided to stay home and enjoy the festivities from afar, watching the live stream on her computer.

Meanwhile, the government officials were scrambling to find a solution to the chaos. They estimated that the festival would bring in a significant amount of revenue for the Republic, but the discomfort of the citizens was causing a public relations nightmare.

In the end, they decided to extend the festival by a week, hoping to spread out the crowds and alleviate some of the discomfort. The move was met with mixed reactions from the citizens, but Lila was grateful for the extra time to enjoy the festivities from the comfort of her own home.
