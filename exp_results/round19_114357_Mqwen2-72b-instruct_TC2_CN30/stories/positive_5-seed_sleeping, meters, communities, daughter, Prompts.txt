In the heart of a bustling city, there was a community of people who lived in high-rise apartments. The buildings were so tall that the distance between the ground and the top floor was measured in meters. Among the residents of this community was a young woman named Maya, who lived on the 20th floor with her daughter, Lily.

Maya worked long hours as a software engineer, and often found herself exhausted by the time she returned home. She would put Lily to bed, tucking her in and reading her a bedtime story, before collapsing onto her own bed. But one night, as she was drifting off to sleep, she heard a strange noise coming from Lily's room.

Maya got up and walked over to the door, listening carefully. It sounded like Lily was talking to someone, but Maya knew that she was alone in the apartment. She opened the door slowly and peered inside, only to find Lily fast asleep, her chest rising and falling gently.

Maya was puzzled, but decided to let it go and return to her own bed. However, the next night, the same thing happened. This time, Maya was determined to get to the bottom of it. She crept into Lily's room and listened carefully, trying to make out what her daughter was saying.

To her surprise, she heard Lily whispering, "Tell me a story, please. I'm not tired yet." Maya realized that Lily must have been talking to her in her sleep, and that she had been responding to her daughter's prompts without even realizing it.

From that night on, Maya made a point of spending more time with Lily before bed, reading her stories and talking to her until she was truly asleep. She realized that the distance between them, measured in meters, was nothing compared to the closeness they shared as mother and daughter. And as they drifted off to sleep together, Maya knew that they were part of a community of love that spanned far beyond the walls of their apartment.
