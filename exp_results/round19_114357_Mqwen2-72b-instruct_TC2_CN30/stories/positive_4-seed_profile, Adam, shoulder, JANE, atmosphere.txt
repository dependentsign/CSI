Adam had always been fascinated by the human profile. The way the nose curved, the shape of the jawline, the angle of the chin. He spent hours studying them, trying to understand what made each one unique. It was his passion, his obsession.

One day, while walking through the bustling streets of the city, Adam spotted a woman with a profile that caught his eye. Her name was JANE, and she had a strong, angular jawline that he had never seen before. He couldn't help but follow her, his eyes fixed on the back of her head.

As he walked behind her, he noticed the way her shoulders moved with each step. They were broad and strong, like the rest of her profile. Adam felt a strange connection to this woman, as if he had been searching for her his entire life.

He followed her into a small coffee shop, where the atmosphere was warm and inviting. JANE sat down at a table by the window, and Adam took a seat across from her. They didn't speak at first, but simply studied each other's profiles in silence.

Finally, JANE broke the silence. "You seem to be very interested in my profile," she said with a smile.

Adam blushed. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare. It's just that I've never seen a profile like yours before. It's so...unique."

JANE laughed. "I get that a lot. But I've never had someone follow me down the street to tell me that before."

They talked for hours, about everything from art to politics to their favorite books. Adam felt a connection to JANE that he had never felt with anyone else. And as they said their goodbyes and parted ways, he knew that he would never forget her profile, or the way her shoulders moved as she walked away.
