In the dimly lit bar, Detective Jack sat nursing his beer, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of the killer he had been searching for hours. The case had been haunting him for weeks, and he was determined to bring the murderer to justice.

As he took another sip of his beer, his attention was drawn to the aroma of roasted meat wafting from the kitchen. His stomach growled, reminding him that he hadn't eaten since breakfast. He signaled to the bartender for a plate of the roasted pork that was causing his mouth to water.

As he waited for his food, Jack's eyes continued to scan the room. Suddenly, he saw a man who matched the description of the killer he was searching for. Jack's heart raced as he watched the man order a beer and take a seat at a table in the corner.

Jack quickly finished his meal and made his way over to the man. "Excuse me," he said, flashing his badge. "I need to ask you a few questions."

The man looked up, his eyes meeting Jack's. "Sure, what do you need to know?" he asked, taking a sip of his beer.

Jack began to ask him questions, his eyes never leaving the man's face. As the man answered, Jack noticed a small detail that confirmed his suspicion. The man's left hand was missing a finger, just like the killer's.

Jack quickly radioed for backup and arrested the man. As they took him away, Jack couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over him. He had finally found the killer he had been searching for, and justice would be served.

As he left the bar, Jack couldn't help but smile. He had spent hours searching for the killer, but it was the simple pleasure of a cold beer and a plate of roasted pork that had led him to his suspect.
