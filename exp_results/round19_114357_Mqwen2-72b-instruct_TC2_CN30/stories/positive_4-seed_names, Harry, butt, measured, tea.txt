Once upon a time, in a quaint little village nestled in the English countryside, there lived a man named Harry. Harry was a tea connoisseur, and he took great pride in his collection of rare and exotic teas from all over the world. He had a special room in his house dedicated to his tea collection, where he would spend hours measuring out the perfect amount of tea leaves for each cup.

One day, while Harry was in the middle of measuring out some tea for his afternoon tea break, he heard a knock on the door. He went to answer it, and there stood a man with a peculiar request. The man, whose name was Butt, explained that he was a researcher studying the effects of tea on the human body, and he needed a sample of Harry's rarest tea for his experiments.

Harry was hesitant at first, but Butt assured him that the tea would be returned to him after the experiments were complete. Harry agreed, and he carefully measured out a small amount of his most prized tea for Butt to take with him.

Days turned into weeks, and Harry began to worry that he would never see his precious tea again. But one day, Butt returned to Harry's doorstep, holding a small package. Inside the package was Harry's tea, along with a note from Butt explaining that the tea had been a great success in his experiments, and that he had even discovered some new health benefits from it.

Harry was overjoyed to have his tea back, and he invited Butt in for a cup of tea to celebrate. As they sipped their tea, Harry and Butt became fast friends, bonding over their shared love of tea and their appreciation for the little things in life. And from that day on, Harry always made sure to measure out an extra cup of tea for his new friend Butt, who would often stop by for a visit and a chat over a steaming cup of Harry's finest brew.
