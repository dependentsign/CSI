Lily walked along the long stretches of the deserted road, her heart heavy with grief. She had just received the news of her father's death, and the weight of it was almost too much to bear. The sky was a dull grey, matching the somber mood that enveloped her.

As she walked, she noticed two men up ahead, their figures looming in the distance. They were dressed in black, and their faces were obscured by the hoods they wore. Lily felt a chill run down her spine as she approached them, but she continued walking, determined not to let her fear get the best of her.

As she drew closer, she could see that the men were carrying a large wooden coffin between them. Lily's heart sank as she realized that it must be her father's casket. She stopped in her tracks, unable to move as the men walked past her, their footsteps heavy on the ground.

One of the men turned to look at her, his eyes meeting hers for a brief moment. Lily felt a strange connection to him, as if she had known him before. But before she could say anything, the men had disappeared around a bend in the road, leaving her alone once again.

Lily continued walking, her mind consumed by thoughts of her father. She wondered where the men were taking the coffin, and why they had been carrying it in the first place. But as she walked, she began to feel a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that her father was in a better place now, free from the pain and suffering that had plagued him in his final days.

As she reached the end of the road, Lily turned to look back at the stretches of road she had just walked. She knew that she would never forget the two men in black, or the strange connection she had felt to one of them. But for now, she was content to let the memories of her father fill her heart, and to find solace in the knowledge that he was finally at peace.
