In the southernmost part of the country, there was a small town where Sayori lived. She had spent her entire life there, working as a nurse in the local hospital. Sayori was known for her kind heart and her dedication to her patients. She had seen countless operations and had taken care of many patients, but there was one operation that stood out in her mind.

It was a particularly difficult surgery, and Sayori had spent hours assisting the surgeon. The patient was a young girl who had been in a terrible accident. Sayori had taken photos of the operation, not for any morbid reason, but to document the progress and to show the girl's family how hard the medical team was working to save her.

The operation was a success, and the girl made a full recovery. Sayori was overjoyed, and she showed the photos to the girl's family, who were grateful for the care their daughter had received. Sayori had spent so much time and energy on the operation, but seeing the girl's smile made it all worth it.

From that day on, Sayori became even more dedicated to her work. She spent long hours at the hospital, taking care of patients and assisting in surgeries. She knew that every operation was a chance to save a life, and she was determined to do everything in her power to make that happen.

Years went by, and Sayori continued to work in the hospital. She had spent her entire life in the south, but she had no regrets. She had found her calling, and she knew that she was making a difference in the lives of others. And whenever she looked at the photos of that one operation, she was reminded of why she had become a nurse in the first place.
