In the quiet of her bedroom, Lily lay in bed scrolling through her phone. She had just finished watching the latest episode of her favorite TV series and was now searching for behind-the-scenes snippets to satisfy her curiosity.

As she scrolled, a notification popped up on her screen. It was a message from an unknown number. Curious, she opened it to find a voice recording. She hesitated for a moment before hitting play.

The voice on the other end was deep and unfamiliar. "Lily, I know you've been accessing information that you shouldn't be. I suggest you stop before it's too late."

Lily's heart raced as she replayed the message. Who was this person and how did they know her name? She quickly deleted the message and turned off her phone, feeling uneasy.

As she lay in bed, she couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. She pulled the covers up to her chin and tried to focus on the peaceful sounds of the night outside her window. But the voice recording kept replaying in her mind, and she couldn't help but wonder what secrets she had stumbled upon.
