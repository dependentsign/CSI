In the kingdom of Eldoria, the law was clear: any attack on the royal lands would result in severe penalties. The penalty for such an offense was imprisonment for life, and the king had made it clear that he would not hesitate to enforce it.

One day, a group of bandits decided to test the law. They had heard rumors of the riches that lay hidden in the royal lands and were determined to claim them for themselves. They prepared for the attack, gathering weapons and supplies, and set out under the cover of darkness.

As they approached the royal lands, they were met with a fierce resistance from the king's guards. The bandits fought bravely, but they were no match for the well-trained soldiers. The battle was short-lived, and soon the bandits were defeated.

The king was furious when he heard of the attack. He ordered that the bandits be brought before him, and when they were, he sentenced them to life in prison without hesitation. The bandits were taken away, and the king vowed to increase the penalties for anyone who dared to attack the royal lands again.

From that day on, the law was taken even more seriously. The king's guards were on high alert, and anyone caught even near the royal lands was immediately questioned. The bandits' attack had served as a warning to all who would dare to challenge the law, and the kingdom of Eldoria remained safe and secure for many years to come.
