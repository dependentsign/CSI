In the small town of Reach, there was a woman named Eliza who had a unique niche. She was a death doula, someone who helped people prepare for the end of their lives. It was a job that many found morbid, but Eliza saw it as a way to help people find peace in their final moments.

One day, Eliza received a call from a man named Jack. His father, who lived in Reach, was dying and he wanted Eliza to come and help him through the process. Eliza agreed and made her way to the man's home.

When she arrived, she found Jack sitting by his father's bedside, tears streaming down his face. Eliza sat down next to him and began addressing the situation. She spoke to Jack about what to expect in the coming days and how to best support his father.

As the days passed, Eliza became a constant presence in the home. She helped Jack's father with his pain management and made sure he was comfortable. She also spoke to him about his life, his regrets, and his hopes for the future.

On the final day, Eliza sat by the man's bedside as he took his last breath. She held his hand and whispered words of comfort to him. When it was over, she turned to Jack and spoke to him about the importance of honoring his father's memory.

In the days that followed, Eliza helped Jack plan the funeral and supported him through his grief. She spoke to him about the importance of finding closure and moving forward.

In the end, Jack was grateful for Eliza's help. He knew that he couldn't have gotten through his father's death without her. And Eliza knew that she had found her niche in life, helping people find peace in the face of death.
