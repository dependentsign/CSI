Once upon a time, in a small village in Iran, there lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was a curious and adventurous child who loved exploring the vast deserts and mountains that surrounded his village. He was always eager to learn new things and discover the mysteries of the world.

One day, while wandering through the desert, Ali stumbled upon a large bowl that was buried in the sand. The bowl was big, much bigger than anything he had ever seen before. It was made of a strange material that he couldn't identify, and it seemed to glow with an otherworldly light.

Ali was fascinated by the bowl and decided to take it back to his village to show his friends and family. However, as he lifted the bowl, he suddenly felt a strange sensation wash over him. It was as if he had been transported to another world, a world where he was the only one in existence.

As he looked around, he saw that he was standing in the middle of a vast, empty space. There was nothing around him except for the bowl, which now seemed to be much bigger than before. Suddenly, a voice boomed out from the bowl, and Ali realized that it was a commentary on the universe itself.

The commentary spoke of the origins of the universe, the mysteries of time and space, and the secrets of the cosmos. Ali listened intently, his mind racing with the knowledge that was being imparted to him. He felt as if he had been given a gift, a gift that would allow him to understand the world in a way that no one else could.

As the commentary came to an end, Ali felt himself being pulled back to the real world. He opened his eyes to find himself back in the desert, the bowl still in his hands. He knew that he had been given a great responsibility, a responsibility to use the knowledge he had gained to help others and to make the world a better place.

From that day on, Ali became known as the wise one in his village. He used the knowledge he had gained from the bowl to help his fellow villagers, to solve their problems, and to guide them through difficult times. And although he never forgot the experience he had had with the bowl, he knew that the true gift he had received was the ability to understand himself and the world around him in a way that no one else could.
