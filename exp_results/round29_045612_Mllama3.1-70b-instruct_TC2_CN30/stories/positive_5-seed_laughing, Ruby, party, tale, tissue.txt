It was a chilly winter evening, and the snowflakes gently fell onto the bustling streets of the small town. Inside a cozy little house, a party was in full swing. The room was filled with the sound of laughter and chatter, and the smell of freshly baked cookies wafted through the air.

Ruby, a bright and cheerful young girl with a mop of curly red hair, was the life of the party. She was laughing and joking with her friends, her eyes sparkling with mischief. As she told a tale of her latest adventure, her friends listened with wide eyes and open mouths.

But just as Ruby was getting to the punchline, she let out a massive sneeze. Her friends gasped in surprise, and Ruby's eyes began to water. She reached for a tissue from the box on the coffee table and blew her nose loudly.

The room fell silent for a moment, and then erupted into laughter. Ruby's friends were laughing so hard they were crying, and Ruby couldn't help but join in. She laughed and laughed, her eyes shining with tears.

As the night wore on, the party only got more lively. Ruby and her friends played games, told stories, and danced to music. It was a night that none of them would ever forget, and Ruby's sneeze had been the icing on the cake.

As the evening drew to a close, Ruby's friends said their goodbyes and thanked her for a wonderful night. Ruby smiled and hugged them tightly, feeling grateful for the wonderful friends she had. And as she drifted off to sleep that night, she was still smiling, her heart full of joy and laughter.
