It had been a year since Sarah had finally settled into her new job at a marketing firm. She had been hesitant to take the position at first, given her past experiences with harassment in the workplace. However, the company had assured her that they took such matters seriously and had a zero-tolerance policy in place.

Sarah had been born with a disability that made it difficult for her to walk long distances. She relied on a wheelchair to get around, and the company had been accommodating in providing her with a accessible workspace.

Despite the initial reservations, Sarah had found the company to be a welcoming and inclusive environment. Her colleagues were friendly and supportive, and she had quickly become an integral part of the team.

However, as time went on, Sarah began to notice that some of her colleagues were not as understanding as she had thought. They would often make thoughtless comments about her disability, or ask invasive questions about her personal life.

At first, Sarah tried to brush it off, thinking that they were just trying to be friendly. But as the comments continued, she began to feel uncomfortable and isolated. She realized that she was experiencing a form of harassment, and that it was not okay.

Sarah decided to speak up and report the incidents to her supervisor. To her surprise, the company took immediate action, providing training to the employees on disability awareness and sensitivity.

The company also implemented new policies to prevent harassment and ensure that all employees felt safe and respected in the workplace. Sarah was grateful for the support and felt a sense of relief that she had finally found a workplace where she could thrive.

As she looked back on the past year, Sarah realized that she had come a long way. She had found a job that she loved, and a company that valued and respected her. She was proud of herself for speaking up and advocating for her rights, and she knew that she would always be able to overcome any obstacle that came her way.
