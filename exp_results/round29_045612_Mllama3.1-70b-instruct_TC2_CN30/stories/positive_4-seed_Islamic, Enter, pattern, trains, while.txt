In the bustling streets of Marrakech, Morocco, a young apprentice named Amir sat cross-legged on the floor of his master's workshop, carefully studying the intricate pattern of an Islamic mosaic. The master, a wise and skilled artisan named Hassan, had spent years perfecting the art of zellij, a traditional Moroccan craft that involved creating beautiful and intricate designs using small, colored tiles.

As Amir worked, he could hear the sound of trains rumbling in the distance, carrying passengers and goods to and from the city. He had always been fascinated by the trains, and often found himself daydreaming about the places they might be going, and the people they might be carrying.

Just then, Hassan entered the workshop, a look of concentration on his face. "Amir, I need you to enter the next phase of your training," he said, his voice low and serious. "You have shown great promise in your work, and I believe you are ready to learn the secrets of creating truly complex and beautiful patterns."

Amir's eyes widened with excitement as Hassan began to explain the intricacies of the craft. While he listened, he carefully watched as Hassan's hands moved deftly, creating a stunning pattern of interlocking tiles. The sound of the trains faded into the background as Amir became completely absorbed in the lesson, his mind focused on the intricate beauty of the zellij.

As the day wore on, Amir found himself becoming more and more skilled, his fingers moving with a newfound confidence as he worked on his own pattern. The sound of the trains returned, but this time, it was accompanied by the sound of Amir's own laughter, as he realized that he was truly beginning to master the art of zellij.
