It was a beautiful summer morning in New Zealand, and Harry had just arrived at the local surf school, eager to catch his first wave. As a beginner, he was a bit nervous, but the instructor, a friendly Kiwi named Jack, put him at ease.

"Don't worry, mate," Jack said with a smile. "We'll have you riding the waves in no time. Just remember to stay relaxed and have fun."

Harry nodded, feeling a bit more confident. Jack suggested they start with a lesson on the beach, where they could practice popping up to their feet on the board.

As they walked along the shore, Jack pointed out the different types of waves and explained how to read the surf. Harry listened intently, taking it all in.

After a while, Jack said, "Okay, now it's time to get in the water. Just paddle out to where I am, and we'll catch a wave together."

Harry nodded, feeling a bit more excited. He paddled out to Jack, who was sitting on his board, waiting for the perfect wave.

As they waited, Jack said, "Remember, when I say 'go,' just start paddling like crazy. You can do it, Harry!"

Suddenly, Jack shouted, "Go!" and Harry started paddling with all his might. The wave started to lift them up, and Harry felt a rush of excitement.

With Jack's help, Harry managed to stand up on the board and ride the wave all the way to shore. He was grinning from ear to ear as he paddled back out to Jack.

"That was amazing!" Harry exclaimed. "I can do this!"

Jack smiled and clapped him on the back. "I told you, mate. You're a natural. Now, let's catch some more waves!"

And with that, Harry spent the rest of the day surfing the waves of New Zealand, feeling like a pro, even though he was still a beginner.
