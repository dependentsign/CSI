It was a sunny day in late August when Emma first stepped foot on the University of Michigan's campus. She had just moved from a small town in the Midwest to pursue her dream of becoming a psychologist. As she walked through the bustling quad, she couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nervousness.

As she made her way to her dorm, Emma noticed a group of students gathered near the student union building. They were all wearing bright yellow t-shirts with the words "Mental Health Matters" emblazoned on the front. Emma's curiosity got the best of her, and she approached the group to learn more.

One of the students, a tall and lanky young man with a warm smile, introduced himself as Alex. He explained that the group was part of a campus organization dedicated to reducing the stigma surrounding mental health issues. Emma was intrigued and asked if she could join.

As they talked, Emma revealed that she had struggled with anxiety and depression in high school. She had always felt like she had to hide her struggles, fearing that her friends and family would judge her. But as she spoke with Alex and the others, she felt a sense of relief wash over her. For the first time, she felt like she could be herself without fear of judgment.

Over the next few weeks, Emma became an active member of the group. She attended meetings, participated in events, and even helped to plan a campus-wide mental health awareness campaign. As she worked with the group, Emma realized that she didn't have to depend on her struggles to define her. She was more than her anxiety and depression; she was a strong and capable individual with a passion for helping others.

As the semester progressed, Emma noticed a shift in the way people approached mental health on campus. More and more students were speaking openly about their struggles, and the stigma surrounding mental health issues began to fade. Emma felt proud to be a part of the movement, and she knew that she had found her place at the University of Michigan.

One day, as Emma was walking across campus, she saw a poster advertising a mental health event. The poster featured a photo of a student holding a sign that read, "My mental health is not my ID." Emma smiled, feeling a sense of pride and belonging. She knew that she was part of a community that was working to break down the stigma surrounding mental health issues, and she was excited to see the impact they could make.
